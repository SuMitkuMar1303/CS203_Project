Sir, We are proposing 3 ideas and we will choose anyone idea for project submission.

Idea 1
(a) Title - Home Security circuit system .
(b) Overall objective - Ring the alarm in selected condition.
(c) If it would be implemented as RTL or software application - yes, it would be able to implement as software application.
(d) functionality - there are 4 boolean variable which give logic 1 with condition the control switch is off, no movement detected, the clock is between 12am and 6am, and the door is closed,respectively.
		    the alarm will ring(Logic 1) when there is a movement detected when control switch is off OR when the door is opened after midnight OR when the door is opened when control switch is on.
Idea 2
(a) Title - Logic solver.
(b) Overall objective - that can take boolean equations with any number of variable and optimize it for 2-level gates solution.
(c) If it would be implemented as RTL or software application - yes, it would be able to implement as software application.
(d) functionality - it would convert a given boolean equation into product of sum (POS) or sum of product (SOP) which eventually give a 2-level gates solution.

Idea 3
(a) Title - Implementation of QM-Method.
(b) Overall objective - it can convert a complex boolen expression into a simple boolen expression as far as poosible.
(c) If it would be implemented as RTL or software application - yes, it would be able to implement as software application.
(d) functionality - All the terms in the Boolean function are tested for possible combination of any two of them, after which a new sets of terms that are smaller by one literal are produced and are further tested 
under the same procedures for further reduction. The same procedures will be repeated until no terms can be combined anymore.
